            The hype for the next season of Indian Premier League is already sky-high after the franchises retained players on Tuesday ahead of the mega auction. The old franchise got the chance to retain four players from the last seasons as Chennai Super Kings, Mumbai Indians, Delhi Capitals and Kolkata Knight Riders retained four players each, while Royal Challengers Bangalore, Sunrisers Hyderabad and Rajasthan Royals chose three each. Punjab Kings were the only team to retain just two players.
