        HTML, in full hypertext markup language, a formatting system for displaying material retrieved over the Internet. Each retrieval unit is known as a Web page (from World Wide Web), and such pages frequently contain hypertext links that allow related pages
        to be retrieved. HTML is the markup language for encoding Web pages. It was designed by the British scientist Sir Tim Berners-Lee at the lear physics laboratory in Switzerland during the 1980s. HTML markup tags specify document elements such as
        headings, paragraphs, and tables. They mark up a document for display by a computer program known as a Web browser. The browser interprets the tags, displaying the headings, paragraphs, a layout that is adapted to the screen size and fonts available
        to it.
